my key pad is a 4*4 keypad therefore has 4+4=8 pins:
pin1 : R1 -> arduino pin d9
pin2 : R2 -> arduino pin d8
pin3 : R3 -> arduino pin d7
pin4 : R4 -> arduino pin d6
pin5 : C1 -> arduino pin d5
pin6 : C2 -> arduino pin d4
pin7 : C3 -> arduino pin d3
pin8 : C4 -> arduino pin d2


----------------------------------------------------
to test the keypad run the sketch_test and check the keys, if the the
arduino terminal prints the key pressed then the keypad pinouts and
the connections are as the ones specified above:
warning 1: my keypad looks like this:

  {'0','1','2','3'},
  {'4','5','6','7'},
  {'8','9','A','B'},
  {'C','D','E','F'}
so change the code according if yours its not like this
warning 2: code will only handle one key pressed at a time.
----------------------------------------------------
In the first part of this lab the arduino is supposed to turn on LEDs
according to the number pressed in the keypad, if 1 is pressed 1 LED 
would turn on, if 2 ... and so on.
but since i have only 4 digital pins left to use (8 already used for 
keypad) my program will only support 4 LED and therefore when u press
1 to 4 keys leds will turn on accordingly and if any other number is 
pressed the output is written in the arduino terminal

pinout for this part of the lab:
the keypad is configured as specified above
the LEDs:

ledPin1 -> D13
ledPin2 -> D12
ledPin3 -> D11
ledPin4 -> D10

------------------------------------------
the second part of the lab is basically the test sketch which outputs 
the key pressed
------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
The last part of the lab is to create a number panel to display 
the number pressed after using the keypad:
for example if you press(in order):
first press 1 then 2 and at last 3 the number shown in the terminal
would be 123 and them check is more than 9 and then output :
invalid number!
in the terminal
the code for this oart is in sketch_pt3_showNum directory
but there is a bug, even tho the number is defined as long, 
if you press these numbers in order:
12345678987
you would get the output:
-539222901
which is clearly wrong this is because the number 12345678987 does not fit 
inside the space of a long variable type, to solve this we could use strings and 
append the input at the end but since it is specified in the lab desc
i will leave this code be and create a new sketch for the debuged version, 
refer to sketch_pt3_debugedVersion for the string version of the code
