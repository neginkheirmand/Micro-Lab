# Micro Lab Projects Repository

Welcome to the Micro Lab Projects Repository! This repository contains the code for various lab projects that showcase my creativity throughout the micro course.

## Project Structure

The different folders in this repository contain individual lab projects, each with my unique approach to the problem described in the [lab_Content](https://github.com/neginkheirmand/Micro-Lab/tree/master/lab_Content) folder. Feel free to explore each project folder to see the code and details of the experiments and innovations I have worked on.
